    <p>What is Low-Life-Fitment all about?</p><br>
<p>Simply put, we are here to promote the “aggressive fitment” movement and showcase some of the latest and greatest cars that are pushing the aggressive fitment limits in one way or another. Stretched tires, low offset & wide wheels is nothing new, people have been doing it throughout Europe and Japan for decades now. So, don’t get confused, we’re not taking any credit, we’re only here to make it bigger and better.</p><br><br>

<p>What exactly is an Aggressive  Fitment?</p><br>
<p>When you see us use these words, we’re referring to a few things.  One would consist of negative offset wheels. Whether you’re running a crazy concave or a nice deep lip on your wheels, as long as it’s wide (usually starts at about 9″ goes up to 13″) it’s right.</p><br><br>

<p>In order to tuck your tires inside your fenders while your rims sit flush with the fender (or poke slightly), you’re going to have to have some kind of stretched tire. Some stretch their tires more then others but at the end of the day it’s all up to the owner to decide how much he wants the rim to poke past the fender, and how much he is going to stretch that tire. Here is an example of a mild, and a somewhat Extreme stretch. The drop is about the same.</p><br><br>

<p>Lastly, lowering, the most important thing. Your top two options are coilovers or air suspension. One of the biggest discussions is Coilovers vs. Airbags! From what we can tell (on our site/forum and various other sites) running true coilovers will get you more respect/attention if you can pull it off. One of the biggest downsides for running coilovers is being limited from driving everywhere.  With bags however, you can avoid any bumps/curbs trouble and just raise the car up and go.  At the end of the day, it really is just a personal preference.</p>
